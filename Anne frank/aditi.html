      The world-renowned German-born diarist, Anne Frank, jotted down her
      experiences as her family went into hiding from Nazis during the
      Holocaust. She spent two years in a “Secret Annex” somewhere in Amsterdam
      before being discovered and deported to concentration camps. Anne got her
      diary as a gift for her thirteenth birthday and wrote down the different
      events during the two years of hiding with her family. She expressed her
      feelings and thoughts, began a novel as well as wrote a bunch of short
      stories because according to her, writing helped in passing time during
      those years. Her diary was later discovered by two helpers and then her
      writings were published as <span>“The Diary of Anne Frank”</span>. Anne’s father Otto
      survived the Holocaust and got to know about her diary from his friend and
      realised that it was an entirely different girl that he knew and said, “I
      had no idea of her depth of thoughts and feelings”. The Diary of Anne
      Frank has been translated into 57 languages and tells an incredible
      perspective of the holocaust through the point of view of a
      thirteen-year-old girl in hiding and shows her extraordinaire storytelling
      as well as unfaltering spirit even amidst the horrible circumstances.
